# Paths with Sum: You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which
# might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a
# given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
# (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
